### High-Level Data Flow Diagram
1.  **User**: Initiates interaction by submitting queries.
2.  **UI**: Captures user input and displays responses.
3.  **Chatbot** Service: Parses input to understandable format for processing.
4.  **NLP Engine**: Interprets the query to determine intent and extract information.
5.  **Database**: Stores and retrieves data on technology stacks and user interactions.
6.  **Recommendation Engine**: Processes interpreted query against database information to generate recommendations.
7.  **External APIs/Resources**: Optionally, enriches the recommendation with the latest data or resources.

Data flows from the user to the UI, into the chatbot service, where it's processed through the NLP engine, with queries and data retrieval from the database or external APIs, resulting in recommendations sent back to the user through the UI.
